# Add Copy Transcript Button

## Overview

Add a button next to the Save Transcript button that copies the transcription text to clipboard with visual feedback

## Rationale

The electronAPI already exposes copyToClipboard() function (line 118 in types/electron.d.ts). The UI already has the Save button pattern with consistent styling. This is a trivial addition using existing infrastructure.
