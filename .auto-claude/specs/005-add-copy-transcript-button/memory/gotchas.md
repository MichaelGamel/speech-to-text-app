# Gotchas & Pitfalls

Things to watch out for in this codebase.

## [2026-01-15 19:43]
Worktree 005-add-copy-transcript-button was created from an empty 'Initial commit' (577370a) that contains no application files. Cannot implement feature without actual codebase.

_Context: Subtask 1.1 - Add Copy Transcript button. The branch needs to be rebased onto a commit that contains the speech-to-text-app source code._
