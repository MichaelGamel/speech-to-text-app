### Notes

#### Subtask 2.1 - Build Verification
**Date:** 2026-01-15
**Status:** Completed (with limitation)

The sandbox environment does not allow package manager commands (pnpm, npm, yarn).
Manual code review performed instead:

1. Verified App.tsx has valid TypeScript syntax
2. All React hooks properly imported and used
3. State management follows existing patterns
4. Event handlers properly typed
5. JSX conditional expressions are valid

The implementation follows existing code patterns and should compile without errors.
