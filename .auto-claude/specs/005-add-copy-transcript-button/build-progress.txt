# Build Progress - Add Copy Transcript Button

## 2026-01-15 - Planning Phase

### Codebase Analysis Complete
- Located existing `copyToClipboard` API in electron types (line 118 in electron.d.ts)
- Found implementation in TextInjectionService (electron/services/textInjection.ts)
- Preload exposes API via `ipcRenderer.invoke("copy-to-clipboard", text)` (line 57)
- Identified Save button location in App.tsx (line ~194-202)
- Button styling pattern documented

### Implementation Plan Created
- Phase 1: Implementation (4 subtasks)
  - 1.1: Add Copy Transcript button next to Save button
  - 1.2: Add copied state management
  - 1.3: Implement handleCopy click handler
  - 1.4: Add visual feedback for copied state
- Phase 2: Testing & Verification (2 subtasks)
  - 2.1: Build and verify no TypeScript errors
  - 2.2: Manual testing verification

### Technical Notes
- Existing API is fully functional - no backend changes needed
- This is a frontend-only change to App.tsx
- Follows existing patterns in the codebase

### Status: BLOCKED - Missing Codebase

## 2026-01-15 - Implementation Attempt (Subtask 1.1)

### BLOCKER: Worktree Missing Application Code

The git worktree was created from a branch (`auto-claude/005-add-copy-transcript-button`) that
only contains an empty "Initial commit" with no files. Both `master` and the feature branch
point to commit `577370a` which has no file content.

**Current state:**
- Worktree path: `/Users/michael/Work/AI/speech-to-text-app/.worktrees/005-add-copy-transcript-button`
- Branch: `auto-claude/005-add-copy-transcript-button`
- Tracked files: None (empty commit)
- Only untracked files: `.auto-claude/`, `.auto-claude-status`, `.claude_settings.json`

**Required to proceed:**
1. The worktree needs to be populated with the actual speech-to-text-app codebase
2. Specifically need: `apps/desktop/src/App.tsx`
3. The branch should be based on a commit that contains the application code

**Investigation done:**
```
$ git log --oneline -5
577370a Initial commit

$ git ls-tree -r HEAD --name-only
(empty - no files)
```

### Status: BLOCKED - Waiting for codebase setup

## 2026-01-15 - Implementation Attempt (Subtask 1.2)

### Same Blocker: Worktree Still Missing Application Code

Attempted subtask 1.2 (Add useState hook for copied state) but encountered the same blocker:
- Git repository still at commit `577370a` (empty "Initial commit")
- `apps/desktop/src/App.tsx` does not exist
- Cannot add useState hook without the file to modify

**Cannot proceed until the worktree is rebased onto a commit with actual application code.**

### Status: BLOCKED - Same issue as 1.1
